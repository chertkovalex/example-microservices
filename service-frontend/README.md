# frontend-service

This is a simple static server service, it come to mock a common deployment pattern, 
where [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/) is used to serve static files
and redirect api request to the api service.

See ```index.js``` for server implementation.

Client code is on the ```src``` folder and bundled to the ```public``` folder.
